## What are some situations where you wouldn’t want to use SVG?

> An example of a situation you wouldn't want to use an SVG would be something like a grunge texture. Or something that is meant to be photo-realistic. SVGs are great for low-detail graphics that are able to scale.

## What are the benefits of “inlining” your SVGs? What are the drawbacks?

> The main benefit of inlining your SVG makes your SVG accessible to your HTML/CSS/JavaScript. It allows you to access its properties via code, which is great if you need to do something to your SVG programmatically, such as scaling. The drawbacks are it makes your code ugly, and hard to read. It adds a lot of bloat to your HTML and makes you have to look through more than the eye really cares to see.
