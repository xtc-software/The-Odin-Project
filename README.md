# Hello! I'm Jacob.
I've initialized this repository to track my progress for [The Odin Project | Full Stack JavaScript ](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript)

What you can expect to find in this repository are commit messages, and things I've deemed necessary to put here while working on The Odin Project, such as individual projects, knowledge-checks, and etc.

## Why?
I'm doing this to highlight my ability as a developer. This includes my commit messages, my design, my thoughts (via comments in the code), and of course the star of the show, my code.
